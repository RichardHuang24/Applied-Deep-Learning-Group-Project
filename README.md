# Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation Framework

This repository contains a flexible framework for experimenting with weakly-supervised semantic segmentation using class activation maps (CAMs).

## Overview

The framework explores the effectiveness of different CNN backbones, initialization methods, and CAM techniques for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. By training only with image-level labels, we can generate reasonable segmentation masks without pixel-level annotations.

## Features

- Experiment with multiple backbones (ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50)
- Compare different model initializations (ImageNet, SimCLR, Random)
- Test various CAM methods (GradCAM, CCAM)
- Automatic dataset download and preparation
- Comprehensive evaluation and visualization

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.7+
- Pillow (PIL)
- tqdm
